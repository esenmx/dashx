# dashx

___
An un-opinionated, dependency free, expressive extensions package. This package focused on productivity rather than
reducing the amount of written code.

##### Examples:

```dart
context.mediaQuery // not implemented
MediaQuery.of(context) // use this instead
// because you'll spend same amount of time by writing and those will be bloat the extensions with no real favor

context.subtitle1TextStyle // is implemented
context.subtitle1 // not implemented
// because another focus is expressiveness, added `TextStyle` suffix is also useful for auto-complete
```
